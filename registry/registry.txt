  The BioDirectory Registry is a simple system for specifying where
to find services which provide sequence databases. A client should look at 
the following places in order to find this file:

   $HOME/.bioinformatics/seqdatabase.ini
   /etc/bioinformatics/seqdatabase.ini
   http://www.open-bio.org/registry/seqdatabase.ini


  The file is a simple stanza format which goes

  [database-name]
  tag=value
  tag=value

  [database-name]
  tag=value
  tag=value

where each stanza starts with the declaration of the database being in square 
brackets and following that one line tag=value tag value formats.

Database-name stanzas can be repeated, in which case the client should
try each service in turn (starting at the first one).

The options under each stanza must have two non-optional tag=value lines being


  protocol=<protocol-type>
  location=<location-string>


protocol currently can be one of

  index-berkeleydb
  index-flat
  biofetch
  bsane-corba
  biosql
  xembl

location is a string specific to the protocol. Any number of
additional tag values are allowed in the stanza which should be passed
to the appropiate constructor of the protocol to interpret. Some
protocols might insist on other mandatory tags
