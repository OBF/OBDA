syntax described in:

  http://www.i3c.org/workgroups/technical_architecture/resources/lsid/docs/LSIDSyntax9-20-02.htm

All flat file formats are identified using this format:

URN:LSID:open-bio.org:<format>/<alphabet>

where <format> is one of:
      embl
      genbank
      fasta
      swiss
      pdb

and <alphabet> is one of:
