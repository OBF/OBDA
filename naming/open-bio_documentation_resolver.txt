OBDA DOCUMENTATION RESLOVER, VERSION 0.2
----------------------------------------

This is a document that specifies a standard way for accessing documentation
associated with OBDA URNs.

The format of OBDA URNs and the standard way of registering URNs and their
documentation is described in OBDA URN FORMATS in the file
naming/open-bio_urns.txt in the CVS module obda-specs in the repository
pub.open-bio.org:/home/repository/obf-common.

There are other mechanisms for resolving URNs to documentation, and this
document does not preclude their use. However, in the absence of anything else,
this is a sensible thing to do.

JUSTIFICATION
-------------

URNs are used to uniquely name resources. In the context of the OBDA, these are
resources associated with biological objects and bioinformatics concepts.
It is a good idea to chose names so that they explain to a human user what they
represent. However, this can not be relied upon, particularly as names that are
obvios to one person may be very non-obvious or even counter-intuitive to
another. To address this, the OBDA URN specification describes a mechanism
whereby URNs and their namespaces can be documented in a human-readable
manner.

The purpose of this document is to describe a simple way that these descriptions
can be accesed using URNs so that users may read them.

THE LIMITS OF THIS PROPOSAL
---------------------------

There is no attempt made in this proposal to describe in detail any API or
implementation that would make any resource availabe. That is wholely the
responsibility of the implementors. It will, however, where apropreate
describe some possible ways of implementing particular portions.

It is expected that where ever possible, a standard API would be used to
implement this specification. For example, in Java, JNDI would be a logical
choice. APIs specific to resolving OBDA URNs in geneal and for resolving
documentation associated with these in particular is discouraged.

RESOLVING OBDA URNS TO DOCUMENTATION
------------------------------------

Documentation for OBDA URNs should be deposited in the naming
directory in the CVS module obda-specs in the repository
pub.open-bio.org:/home/repository/obf-common as described in the document
OBDA URN REGISTRATION AND DOCUMENTATION (naming/open-bio_directory.txt).

An OBDA URN documentation service should accept an OBDA URN and return the
documentation associated with that URN. The documentation should be equivalent
to the documentation deposited in the cannonical directory. 

Some naming and directory systems allow meta-data to be attached to the
entries. In this case, documentation may be accessible via the appropreate
meta-data key.

EXAMPLES
--------

Assuming that there was a JNDI implementation of the OBDA URN documentation
service, the following would be possible.

DirContext obdaDocService = ...;

ObdaUrn emblUrn = ObdaUrn.valueOf("urn:open-bio.org:format:embl");
ObdaUrn formatNsUrn = ObdaUrn.valueOf("urn:open-bio.org:format");

System.err.println("Resloving " + emblUrn + " to documentation:"); 
System.out.println(obdaDocService.lookup(emblUrn);

System.err.println("Resolving " + formatNsUrn " + to documentation:");
System.out.println(obdaDocService.lookup(formatNsUrn);
