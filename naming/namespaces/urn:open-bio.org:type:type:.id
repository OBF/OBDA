The OBDA URN that identifies the concept of 'type'. In a given language, this
may map to the types of data structures, or objects. Alternativel, it may
map to a particular set of keys being present in a map, or a term in an
ontology. This is not important. The important thing is that we have unique
identifiers for common types that all projects use and interact with.
