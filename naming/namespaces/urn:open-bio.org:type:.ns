The namespace for URNs that identify data types. It is expected that the types
that are given IDs will be very general in nature, such as Sequence and
File Format. All types are of type urn:open-bio.org:type:type. Any URN in the
type namespace that is not of this type is not conforming to the OBDA
specification for this namespace.
