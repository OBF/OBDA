A biological sequence alphabet. Biological sequences are often represented as
strings of characters. However, in differnt circumstances, the same characters
can represent different things. For example, in DNA, the 't' character
represents tyrosine. In Protein, this same character represents tryptophan.

Associating alphabets with these sequences disambiguates their interpretation.
Alphabets do not define a mapping to or from strings, but should be used
wherever the type of the content of a sequence needs to be stated.
