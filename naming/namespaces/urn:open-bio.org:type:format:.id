A file format. Many file formats are used in bioinformatics. Entities of this
type identify a format. The format can be used to choose how to treat a file.
The format is not expected to be resolvable to a formal deffinition of the
file structure using OBDA-supplied functionality. Different applications may
chose to process a stream with the same format URN in different ways. This
type of URN is purely there to identify the format of the stream, not the
manner in which it should be processed.
