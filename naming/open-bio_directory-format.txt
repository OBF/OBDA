OBDA URN DIRECTORY XML FILE FORMAT, VERSION 0.1
-----------------------------------------------

This is a document that specifies how to store OBF URNs in an XML formatted
file so that all projects can retrieve the URNs along with any meta-data
associated with them.

This does not describe the form of a legal OBF URN, or any mechanism for
programatically resloving or validating a URN.


JUSTIFICATION
-------------

To share URNs between all OBF projects and beyond, it is necisary to publish
the URNs in a way that allows them to be manipulated in a variety of languages
on a number of platforms. File-system based approaches have proven to be
brittle to the peculiarites of different file systems directory seperators and
escape characters. XML is widely supported, and is platform neutral.


THE DIRECTORY ELEMENT
---------------------

Every directory file starts with a <directory> element. This contains one child
element for each urn being declared. It can have zero or more urn children.


THE URN ELEMENT
---------------

Every URN is defined by a <urn> element. This has an attribute giving the full
name of the URN as a string. The child elements provide meta-data for the URN,
and the description child is mandatory.


THE DESCRIPTION ELEMENT
-----------------------

Every URN will have exactly one <description> child element that provides
a human readable description of the URN. In the general case, this will be
plain text. All whitespace in this element may be significant, and should be
preserved.


TODO
----

Schema for this simple XML, providing hooks for adding extra meta-data.
