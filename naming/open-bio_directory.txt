OBDA URN REGISTRATION AND DOCUMENTATION, VERSION 0.1
----------------------------------------------------

This is a document that specifies a standard way for registering OBDA URNs.

JUSTIFICATION
-------------

There needs to be agreement about the stoorage of 'cannonical' URNs and their
meta-data, including descriptions. There are multiple ways to achieve this,
which can be implented independantly of the details of the syntax or semantics
of the URNs.

THE DIRECTORIES FILES
---------------------

A directory naming/directories should be populated with files containing
collections of URNs. These should be in the format described by
naming/open-bio_directory-format.txt and there should be one file for each
logical grouping of URNs.

The complete set of OBDA URNs is found by loading all URNs from all files in
the directories folder.

There must never be any duplicate entries.
