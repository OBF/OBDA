OBDA URN FORMATS, VERSION 0.2
-----------------------------

This is a document that specifies how to construct uniform resource names (URNs)
for common concepts and entities used within the OBDA and other OBF projects.

A list of the names of specific concepts or entities will be provided in
seperate documents, as described in "DOCUMENTING IDENTIFIERS" below.

Any process by which a URN may be resolved to either some
other URI, or to a concrete data item (such as an object or a file) is outside
the scope of this document. It is expected that standard APIs, such as JNDI
be used. We strongly discourage the generation of APIs specific to resolving
OBDA URNs to resources unless there is no available API that can be re-used.
In the case that there is no such API, we strongly reccomend that a
general-purpose URN resolving API is developed, and that the resolution of
OBDA URNs is used as a test-case and first use-case.

Identifiers for entities such as embl sequence records are addressed by the
LSID specification, and therefore fall outside the scope of this document.


JUSTIFICATION
-------------

All of the OBDA and OBF projects share a large number of concepts with
one another. These include things like the DNA alphabet, the Embl file format
and the BLAST application. There are also other entities that are represented
by different programatic types in each case, such as Sequence, Feature and
Sequence Database.

Within a single project, it is often convenient to identify these concepts using
some string as an identifier. For example, the DNA alphabet in BioJava can be
resolved by the AlphabetManager class from the string literal "DNA".

Between projects, there is a need to communicate shared concepts, regardless
of the fact that different projects may represent these in different ways. For
example, each project has parsers for the Embl file format. It would be
beneficial if one project could store a persistent identifier that flags a
resource as being in the Embl format, and another project could understand this.
Applications such as flat-file indexing would be enhanced by this capability.

The main purpose of this documentation is to define some rules for constructing
URNs that can be shared within the OBDA and between open-bio projects while
minimizing the possibilty of ambiguity or namespace clashes.


WHAT WE DO AND DON'T EXPECT TO BE NAMING
----------------------------------------

The OBDA URNs are expected to be used to identify concepts and entities that
can potentialy be shared between multiple open-bio projects. We would prefer
the logcal owners of the concepts to scope the URNs within their own namespaces,
but in the cases where this is either not yet possible, or there is no clear
owner, we should define URNs ourselves. If a relevent third party does provide a
URN for a concept, that URN should be used, and no open-bio URN will be
generated.


RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN URNS ARE NOT MODELLED BY THIS SPECIFICATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

No attept in this document is made to define relationships between URNs. For
example, if there was a URN for the concept of a biological Alphabet and there
was a URN for the alphabet DNA, this specification will not address the
question of any programatic mechanism that would allow the DNA URN to be used to
discover that it represents a resource of a type compattible with the Alphabet
URN. It is expected that external documents, such as RDF, or external naming and
directory technologies, such as LDAP can be adapted to provide this
functionality.


THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT SPECIFY HOW TO DECIDE ON URNS OR URN NAMESPACES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

OBF URNs are for the benefit of the complete OBF community. As such, it is
expected that the community as a whole, or some subsection thereof will decide
what entities need URNs, and how to structure those URNs within the guidelines
described in this document. It is not within the scope of this document to
describe this process.


CASE AND CHARACTER SET ISSUES
-----------------------------

This specification assumes that two OBF URNs can be compared in a
case-insensitive manner. It also assumes that polite handling of these URNs
will maintain case. For example, if an application receives a URN in all lower-
case, it would be impolite to print the same URN out, or otherwise expose it
in any other combination of cases.

This specification says nothing about how to treat different character sets.
At this time, there is no guidelines about how to represent URNs with exotic
characters such as Chinese or Klingon. In these cases, if they arise, we
should defer to the guidelines in the URN specification.


PREFIXES FOR OBDA URNS
----------------------

All OBDA URNs should be prefixed with the litteral string:

  urn:open-bio.org

[open questions: do we need to register this URN space? Do we need to register
to comply with the urn rules or to ensure that nobody else registers the space?
Is it OK to register/use the space associated with urn:obda or urn:obda.org
despite the fact that www.obda.org is owned by a different organisation?]


STRUCTURE OF OBDA URNS
----------------------

The prefix should be seperated from the suffix with a colon (':'). The suffix
can be treated as an opaque string. It is recomended, however, that the
suffix be composed from one or more identifiers seperated by a colon.
It is strongly reccomended that colon characters not be used within identifiers.
If it is necisary to contain this character, it should be escaped according to
the normal URL escaping rules.

The left-most identifier is the most significant. For example, the URN

  urn:open-bio.org:foo:bar:baz

can be considered from left to right to have the identifiers foo, bar and baz.
The first identifer scopes all following identifiers. For example, the URNs

  urn:open-bio.org:foo:baz

and

  urn:open-bio.org:bar:baz

both contain a seccond componet 'baz'. No assumptions can be made that in these
two cases, 'baz' has the same meaning. This is because in both cases, 'baz'
must be considered within the context of being a direct descendant of the
preceeding identifers - in this case 'foo' and 'bar'.

Identifiers following common identifers can be assumed to be within the same
namespace and are directly comparable. For example, in the URNs

  urn:open-bio.org:foo:bar

and

  urn:open-bio.org:foo:baz

the identifiers 'bar' and 'baz' can be compared to one another, because they are
both scoped within the namespace 'foo'.


STRUCTURE OF OBDA URN COMPONENT IDENTIFIERS
-------------------------------------------

The individual componets of an OBDA URN can be treated as opaque strings. It is
expected that in the case where some internal structure is requred, that the
'/' character will be used to construct a hieracy of internal identifiers.
This should be interpreted in the usual manner as a path within some directory
or tree structure.

If an internal identifier needs to be parameterised with some further
information, the usual URL syntax of query fragments should be employed as is
used for CGI scripts. The '?' character should be used to seperate the first
part of the identifier from the parameterization. Perameters should be encoded
as name=value pairs, and individual pairs should be seperated by the semi-colon
(';') character.

[open question: it has been pointed out by Brian King that this introduces
some potential problems with comparing URNs that have the same query parameters
in different orders. Should we allow this syntax at all?]

The common case of a URN component that encodes version information should be
represented as an identifer of the following form:

  identifier_string?version=<version_number>

where <version_number> is replaced by the actual version number e.g. 1.7. It is
assumed that unless specified, the version is unimportant, that is, the URN
represents an unchanging concept.

[open question: have I got this right - amphersans ('&') are a bad choice and
I think URLs allow both pluss signs ('+') and semi-colons (';').]

[open question: should we allow the other fragment identifiers - pipe ('|') and
pound ('#') to be used as well? Their use should follow the normal semantics
i.e. pipe should locate a fragment of the resource using query parameters and
pound should locate the entire resource but locate the cursor at the position
specified by the query. I am not sure that the semantics of this are clear for
the case of URNs.]


IDENTIFIER PREFIXES AS IDENTIFIERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
-----------------------------------------------------

The identifier

  urn:open-bio.org:foo:bar

has the prefix:

  urn:open-bio.org:foo

The presence of the former URN does not imply that the latter one exists or is
meaningful. It also does not imply that it does not exist or is not
meaningful.


DECLARING AND DOCUMENTING IDENTIFIERS
-------------------------------------

All documenting information should be as widely readable as possible.
As such, the use of plain text or xml formats is strongly reccomended.
The details of the method for persisting a registry is beyond the scope of
this document, but one such method is described in the file
open-bio_directory.txt in the directory naming of the module obda-spec in the
CVS repository located at pub.open-bio.org:/home/repository/obf-common.

Human readable descriptions of each OBDA URN and each namespace should be
deposited in the apropreate obda namespace repository.

When an OBDA URN is documented, it is strongly recomended that the
namespace that contains the URN is also documented.

Minimally, every URN declared should be accompanied by a human readable
description. This is not intended to be machine parseable, and any software
that relies upon parsing these descriptions is unsupported. A particular URN
may optionaly have further meta-data associated with it, such as relationships
to other URNs. The details of this are not defined by this document, and may
be specific to the implementation of the obda namespace repository.


TYPE IDENTIFIERS AND NAMESPACES
-------------------------------

The namespace under urn:open-bio.org:type is reserved for URNs identifying
common types for entities. It is expected that this will become populated with
a range of identifiers for each type that is shared between projects. As a
convention, it is convenient to scope identifiers for instances of a type by
the type identifier. For example, if a type is defined as:

  urn:open-bio.org:type:alphabet

it may be convenient to store identfiers for individual alphabets under the
namespace:

  urn:open-bio.org:alphabet

This is not a formal requirement of the specification. This convention should
in no way be relied upon by code that acts upon OBDA URNs. It is meerly
provided as a way for our URN space to become self-organising. Namespaces that
follow this convention should state this clearly in the associated .ns
documentation. It is recomended that namespaces that do not follow this
convention should state this fact in their documentation.

Namespaces that document that all child names must represent entities of a
particular type may also state that any child not of this type is not a valid
OBDA URN. While this specification does not provide a mechanism to prove
the type of identifiers, it is very strongly reccomended that this restriction
be honoured. If at some time in the future a further reccomendation is formed
that allows the types of URNs to be proved, this strong reccomendation will
be strengthened to become a requirement.

SOME EXAMPLE OBF URNS
---------------------

Four common file formats

  urn:open-bio.org:format:embl
  urn:open-bio.org:format:genbank
  urn:open-bio.org:format:swissprot
  urn:open-bio.org:format:fasta

Three common alphabets

  urn:open-bio.org:alphabet:dna
  urn:open-bio.org:alphabet:rna
  urn:open-bio.org:alphabet:protein

Fasta files with two different alphabets
  urn:open-bio.org:format:fasta?alphabet=urn:open-bio.org:alphabet:dna
  urn:open-bio.org:format:fasta?alphabet=urn:open-bio.org:alpahbet:protein

A versioned identifier for the swiss-prot format that corresponds to a
particular swiss-prot release

  urn:open-bio.org:format:swissprot?version=35

If we wished to expose a name for the accession lines in swissprot in version
35, a reasonable way to express that would be

  urn:open-bio.org:format:swissprot?version=35:AC

The shared concepts of sequence, feature and database

  urn:open-bio.org:type:sequence
  urn:open-bio.org:type:feature
  urn:open-bio.org:type:database

The shared concept of the type associated with the identifier of a sequence

  urn:open-bio.org:type:sequence:identifier

The not-so-shared concept of the type associated with a biojava sequence

  urn:open-bio.org:type:biojava/sequence

And of the identifier associated with a biojava sequence

  urn:open-bio.org:type:biojava/sequence:identifier


CAUTIONARY REMARKS
------------------

The above examples are to describe different possible uses of the OBDA URN
specification in generating identifiers for shaired concepts. It is not meant
to endourse any of those identifiers as being in use.

The question of whether to make a compound identifier, or to add a new namespace
is a value judgement. In some cases, it is clear cut because the entity being
named is clearly only valid within some other context. In this case, the
context within which is valid should appear before it in the URN. In other
cases, such as for the biojava sequence type, it is more consistent to treat
the extra information as part of a structured identifier.

Although there are clearly inheritance and partative relationships between the
example URNs above, we repeat that this document does not attempt to define a
formal way of specifying these relationships. This is wholely outside the
scope of this document.

LOOSE ENDS
----------

We may need to provide a formal deffinition of the different components of our
URNs as BNF or regular expressions, or even as an explicit list of allowed and
diss-allowed characters. This may aid implementers to write parsers and
formatters for them.
